## Origin of the Idea
The author believes understanding concepts is different when compared to application of the same. Lot of courses, training materials, practice environment, etc are present for a user to work with. Everything comes at a price which can be eazily afforded by some and can not be afforded by others specially students. The works of authors are not respected as it should be, piracy is prevelant and has become difficult to stop it. Blue Team labs are not in the same number as the Red Team labs, so the practical implementation of concepts of a blue teamer is difficult.

With respect to the above thoughts, the author intends to create a project to minimize the factors causing the problems.
