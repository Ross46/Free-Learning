# Why This Model ???

## Below is a list of some popular playgrounds
1. [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/about/)  
    Vulnhub by [g0tmi1k](https://twitter.com/g0tmi1k?) is a great site to download and hack Linux VM, It has authors creating single VM, or multiple VM in series, storyline, etc. It is free of cost and really a great site to increase your Linux hacking skills.  

    Gain from Vulnhub:  
    * Looking at the contributions to vulnhub without any gain is positive note that has benifits for both users and authors.


2. [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)  
    Hack The Box is another great site for learning. VPN tunnel to the hosted VM (Linux and Windows) and hack like you own the network.  
    Simple and Straight (Sweet).  

    Free 20 Active Machines and Active Challenges:  
    Users can register for free and hack the VM, gain ranks, imporve skills  

    Paid:    
    * VIP: Get access to all the Live and Active machines with a much less traffic network.
    * Labs: These are the exclusive staff created labs purchased separately from VIP. Active Directory, Red Team Labs, etc. A nice Hunting ground for Red Teamers.

    Gain from Hack The Box:
    * Contribution by the community for VM and dedicated team to setup and run the entire infrastructure. People pay for the quality of the Labs and Service.

3. [Offensive-Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/)  
    OffSec certification are highly sought after. OSCP (OMG he has OSCP),
    OSCE (Damn that guy is 1337), thats the reaction out there. Try harder is their moto, and their training modules are highly sought after and one of the soughtafter pirated videos and manuals. Their practical labs are equally sought after. A bit pricey but really close guarded secrets in there.  

    Gain from Offensive-Security:
    * The right content and fabulous labs attracts a huge crowd. The discipline and close guarded secrets make it even more sought after.

Authors Idea:  
  * Implementing the Vulnhub's model authors can create a series of VM having a variety of flaws and develop a storyline to hack.  
  * Setting up of labs is quite a tedious task for an individual. But you dont learn unless you try it on your own. The community can help set up lab at your place by setting up configuration scripts.
  * Users like quality content but prefer to get it for free and the brand name pays a long way. A lot of authors can create the Proof of Concept for the labs they author and its a win win situation as the author gets recognition and complete credits for his work and no piracy of his contents as its already out for free. Students learn for free, the author being an university student knows the cash crunch and the present Coronavirus situation has made life hard for them, Free-Learning wants to offer its services for free.
